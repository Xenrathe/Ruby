# Ruby

A collection of small Ruby projects:

-substring.rb implements a substrings function that takes a dictionary of words and analyzes any string to determine the number of occurences of any word in the dictionary

-bubble_sort.rb implements bubble sort, for either strings or numbers (but not both)

-Caesar_cipher.rb implements basic encryption scheme, that of a alpha-numeric offset, as famously pioneered by Julius Caesar. It supports both positive and negative shifts, will maintain punctuation, and will wrap around (a shift of 27 would be the same as a shift of 1).

-stock_picker.rb implements a stock picker function that, given an history of prices for a single stock, will return the best day to buy/sell.
